  <p>I graduated from <a href="https://ansci.cals.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> receiving a Bachelorâ€™s in Animal Science.
    In 2012, I earned my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from <a href="https://www.westernu.edu/veterinary/">Western University of Health Sciences</a> in Pomona, California.
    I elected to continue training back on the east coast, doing a small animal rotating internship at Garden State Veterinary Specialists.
    Afterwards I remained with the company for an additional year as an emergency clinician. The past few years I have been working at various
    practices in Long Island such as North Shore Animal League and Village Vets of Long Island.
    <br>
    In my spare time, I enjoys traveling with his wife to different countries and learning about their culture through their food.
    As well as spending time with our two kids and their dog Maddie, who is a rescue I adopted while at NSALA.</p>
